## How to submit your code assignment

1. Fork the project from GitHub.
2. Make your forked project to **private** 
3. Add **ibmq2c** as member via **Manage Access**. From 'Settings' tab -> 'Manage access' -> 'Invite teams or people' -> Search for **ibmq2c** -> add  **ibmq2c** to this repository.
4. Complete your code and documentation in the forked project.
5. Create a new plain text file in the root folder of the forked project. And make the file name in the format of "your full name", e.g. **Mark Leon**.
6. Notify the code assignment is done or you can contact your employer to notify the same (we would be regularly checking the repo for any checkins).

OR

1. Send the file/s to the interviewer or recruiter and you may ask them to share the file to the concerned point of contact/hiring team.
